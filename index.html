    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
        I am currently enrolled in Kenzie Academy and I am loving it! Making this page in class just to give
        and example of what I have learned so far. I came to Kenzie with a degree in electrical engineering 
        from Rose-Hulman and I was working in manufacturing but I didn't like it. I always liked programming
        but only had a little bit of experience and not enough to get into the software world. Kenzie is the
        answer to that problem. Looking forward to learning more in my time here.
