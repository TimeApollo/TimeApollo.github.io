            <h3>About me</h3>
            <section>
                <p>
                    I am currently enrolled in Kenzie Academy and I am
                    <b>
                        <i>loving</i>
                    </b> it! Making this page in class just to give and example of what I have learned so far. I came to Kenzie
                    with a degree in electrical engineering from Rose-Hulman and I was working in manufacturing but I didn't
                    like it. I always liked programming but only had a little bit of experience and not enough to get into
                    the software world. Kenzie is the answer to that problem. Looking forward to learning more in my time
                    here.
